### Corona and Coronal Holes of Sun
Coronal holes are areas in the Sun's atmosphere that appear dark in X-ray and ultraviolet images of the Sun. The plasma (electrified gas) in these regions of the Sun's corona (it's upper atmosphere) is cooler and more dense than in other parts of the corona.

In most places on the Sun, magnetic field lines loop back onto the Sun's surface. Plasma in those regions flows along the field lines, giving rise to features like coronal loops and solar prominences. However, the magnetic field lines in coronal holes do not loop back down. Scientists call these "open field lines." Plasma flowing upward through the corona can more easily escape into space along these open magnetic field lines at coronal holes.
