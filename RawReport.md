### Introduction
Coronal holes are areas in the Sun's atmosphere that appear dark in X-ray and ultraviolet images of the Sun. The plasma (electrified gas) in these regions of the Sun's corona (it's upper atmosphere) is cooler and more dense than in other parts of the corona.

In most places on the Sun, magnetic field lines loop back onto the Sun's surface. Plasma in those regions flows along the field lines, giving rise to features like coronal loops and solar prominences. However, the magnetic field lines in coronal holes do not loop back down. Scientists call these "open field lines." Plasma flowing upward through the corona can more easily escape into space along these open magnetic field lines at coronal holes.

***Solar Wind*** : The solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of the Sun, called the corona. This plasma mostly consists of electrons, protons and alpha particles with kinetic energy between 0.5 and 10 keV.

***Solar Flare*** : Solar flares are gaint bursts of X ray and energy which  travels at light speed in all the direction. Solar flares can be seen from the observatory as a flash of light from the sun.

***Coronal Mass Ejection*** : CME's are gaint clouds of particles ejected by sun into the space. It takes 3 days for a CME to reach earth. CME's are seen as erruptions spreading out into space.
